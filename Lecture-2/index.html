  Comments in javascript are written like this. var is keyword used for declaration of variables in javascript, we don't need to mention or write the type of variable. Javascript figures it automatically what type of data is placed in the variable, on the basis of which variable type to that variable is set by javascript. Every Statement in javascript ends with a terminator or semicolon which can be seen from above. 
  
  The basic syntax of writing a variable is just writing keyword var followed by your variable name.
  example:
    var name;
  
  */
  
  
  name = "Basit";   /* assigning a value to a variable. You can assign anything to a variable either int data like 1,2,3 or array or float etc */
